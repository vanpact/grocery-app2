# Spec Quality Checklist: Grocery App Committed Baseline Bootstrap

**Purpose**: Validate requirement quality (completeness, clarity, consistency, measurability, and coverage) for committed baseline scope.
**Created**: 2026-02-23
**Feature**: `specs/001-baseline-spec-bootstrap/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are requirements defined for how list operations behave when authentication succeeds but household membership resolution fails? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-013` and `SC-007` with explicit deny + recovery behavior).
- [x] CHK002 Are role requirements complete for all actor types that can initiate item state changes, including service/system actors if any exist? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Assumption] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-014`, `FR-026`, and `SC-019` actor-scope constraints).
- [x] CHK003 Are lifecycle requirements documented for all non-happy-path transitions (including invalid and no-op transitions)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-015` and `SC-008` transition outcome semantics).
- [x] CHK004 Are Active Shopping inclusion and exclusion rules fully documented beyond the single `validated` filter statement? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Ambiguity] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-016` and `SC-009` ordering/exclusion rules).

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK005 Is "replay safely" defined with explicit handling semantics for partial mutation failures and retry ordering? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006, Ambiguity] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-017`, `FR-018`, `SC-010`, and `SC-011`).
- [x] CHK006 Are "strict household isolation" requirements explicit about read metadata queries, aggregates, and event streams? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-019` and `SC-012`).
- [x] CHK007 Is "gate-controlled" defined with concrete activation conditions and ownership for optional modules? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-021`, `FR-026`, and `SC-013`).
- [x] CHK008 Are release-blocking conditions described with unambiguous pass/fail thresholds for each committed verification rule? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012, Spec §SC-001..SC-006] - Finding: PASS (SC mapping to `VR-COM-*` is explicit; blocker rule is identified).

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK009 Are lifecycle transition requirements in the feature spec consistent with the security transition contract (`draft/suggested/validated/bought`)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003, Contract §Committed Transition Rules] - Finding: PASS (state vocabulary and allowed transitions align).
- [x] CHK010 Are event-type requirements consistent between functional requirements and event entity vocabulary (including committed vs optional event types)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Entity Event] - Finding: PASS (committed set in FR-008 is a subset of entity vocabulary, without conflict).
- [x] CHK011 Are UX requirement statements consistent between user story acceptance scenarios and FR-level commitments for state visibility and responsiveness? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010] - Finding: PASS (story acceptance and FR commitments align).

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK012 Can each success criterion be objectively evaluated without additional undocumented interpretation steps? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-006] - Finding: PASS (each SC has measurable verification intent, though some operational detail is externalized to tests/contracts).
- [x] CHK013 Are acceptance criteria traceable one-to-one to corresponding `VR-COM-*` identifiers without missing mappings? [Traceability, Spec §SC-001..SC-006] - Finding: PASS (SC-001..SC-006 map directly to committed verification IDs).
- [x] CHK014 Are acceptance criteria explicit about required evidence form (counts, logs, emulator outputs, UX artifacts) for each committed rule? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-012, Gap] - Finding: PASS (evidence contract and quickstart define evidence bundle/file expectations).

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK015 Are primary flow requirements complete for sign-in, add, validate, offline queueing, and reconnect replay in one continuous scenario? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1] - Finding: PASS (core sequence is captured in US1 and FR set).
- [x] CHK016 Are alternate flow requirements documented for dedup collisions across different lists and concurrent actors? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §Edge Cases] - Finding: PASS (dedup/concurrency are explicitly listed as edge cases).
- [x] CHK017 Are exception-flow requirements complete for denied transitions, denied cross-household operations, and retry behavior after failures? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §Edge Cases] - Finding: PASS (deny flows and retry/error-recovery appear in requirements and event set).
- [x] CHK018 Are recovery-flow requirements explicit for reconnect after prolonged offline periods and replay interruption mid-stream? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-006, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-018`, `FR-024`, and `SC-011`/`SC-017`).

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK019 Are requirements explicit for mutation ordering and idempotency when duplicate mutation IDs appear in replay queues? [Edge Case, Spec §SC-001, Spec §FR-006] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-017`, `SC-010`).
- [x] CHK020 Are requirements explicit for simultaneous edits to the same item by multiple household members? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-020`, `SC-014` conflict policy).
- [x] CHK021 Are requirements explicit for optional feature fallback behavior when gate decision is `cut` during active sessions? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-011] - Finding: PASS (fail-closed fallback intent is explicitly stated in FR-011 and gate policy).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK022 Are non-functional performance requirements sufficiently quantified beyond zero data-loss/duplicate metrics (for latency and responsiveness)? [Non-Functional, Plan §Performance Goals, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-022`, `SC-015` thresholds).
- [x] CHK023 Are accessibility requirements documented for keyboard-only operation, focus visibility, and semantics on web and Android? [Non-Functional, Spec §User Story 3, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-023`, `SC-016` baseline).
- [x] CHK024 Are navigation stability requirements defined for app lifecycle transitions (foreground/background) with measurable criteria? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-005, Spec §SC-006, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-024`, `SC-017` lifecycle criteria).

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK025 Are assumptions about Firebase Auth/Firestore availability and offline persistence behavior explicitly documented with fallback expectations? [Dependencies, Plan §Technical Context, Assumption] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-025`, `SC-018` degraded-mode assumptions).
- [x] CHK026 Are external dependency boundaries and ownership documented for security rule maintenance and emulator evidence generation? [Dependencies, Plan §Technical Context, Gap] - Finding: PASS (addressed by `FR-026` and contract ownership matrix).

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK027 Is the relationship between "committed baseline" and future optional modules defined clearly enough to prevent scope bleed in requirement interpretation? [Ambiguity, Spec §CA-002] - Finding: PASS (committed vs optional boundaries are explicit across FR-011 and CA-002).
- [x] CHK028 Are there any conflicting requirement statements between canonical docs (`specs/00`, `specs/10`, `specs/20`, `specs/30`) and this feature spec references? [Conflict, Spec §CA-003] - Finding: PASS (no direct conflicts identified in the referenced baseline alignment).
- [x] CHK029 Is a stable requirement-ID and section-reference scheme defined to prevent drift during future checklist and gate updates? [Traceability, Spec §FR-012, Gap] - Finding: PASS (FR/SC IDs and `VR-COM-*` identifiers provide stable traceability anchors).

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add findings inline under each checklist item when reviewing
- Each item targets requirement quality, not implementation behavior
